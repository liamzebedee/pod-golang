- design: identify transactions uniquely
    using hash and string??
    not completely unique
    need a per-session identifier which is better? 
    or something
    some uniqueness parameter
- design: implement signatures
    backlog for now
- optimization: separate backlog for each replica, since votes can be processed in parallel
- bug: we don't process the vote backlog yet.
